# Solving_differential_eqautions
Solving the differential equations of planet moving in the gravitational field of a heavy star for a given hamiltonian using  using Euler, velocity Verlet, and RK4 methods
a) As the initial condition, choose r = r0 and the speed 30 km/s. I solve the differential equations using Euler,
velocity Verlet, and RK4, for h = δt ∼ 1 day, for t_final = 2 years.
b)I plot the total energy of the system as a function of time for each of the above solution.
c) Now I choose RK4 as your method and set h = δt ∼ 1 hour. Vary the initial speed from 5 km/s
to 200 km/s
d) I plot the trajectories (for 1 year, in a single graph) for all initial speed values.
